# Plutonem-FluxC-Android
Plutonem-FluxC-Android is a networking and persistence library that helps to connect and sync data from the remote Plutonem server.

Based on the Flux pattern, we're using: Dagger2 for dependency injection, WellSql for persistence.

FluxC is pronounced ‘fluxy’, and stands for ‘Flux Capacitor’. This makes a double reference to the architecture model (since a capacitor is a kind of storage unit, or ‘store’). More importantly, a flux capacitor is the core component of the DeLorean time machine in Back to the Future, which ‘makes time travel possible.’
